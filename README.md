Tech companies around the world are capitilizing on your online activity data. Why shouldn't you?

Metro's Chrome Extension lets you track *your own* activity in the browser. Each of these DataSources lets you capture a different kind of activity - the news articles you read, the music you listen to, etc.. 

The Metro [website](https://getmetro.co) lets you combine your activity with your friends or online community, to create shared Activity Feeds about whatever you want!
